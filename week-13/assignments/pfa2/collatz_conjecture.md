# Collatz Conjecture

![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/collatz_conjecture.png)

- Who discovered it? 

Lothar Collatz, a mathematician.
Not really a discovery (but depends on the lens on which you see mathematical discoveries), it is a *conjecture*, so "a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found".


- When? 

1937

- What sort of phenomena does it describe? 

The nice thing about the conjecture is that it describes an invisible relationship among numbers. Whatever number we throw into the conjecture, it will always go down to 1. I think it's one of the few mathematical mysteries that really bring us into a religion dimension. 
As far as I know, no physical phenomena are described using this conjecture.


- Can it be plotted in interesting ways? (show us!)

Here comes the best part!
There is this awesome video showing the shapes that arise when visualising the conjecture in 3d (just keep patience for the first minutes, it slowly builds up): [https://vimeo.com/239293551](https://vimeo.com/239293551)


- Has it been used in an artistic context? 

This nice Numberphile video shows how the conjecture can be used to generate coral-like drawings: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqKpkdRRLZw&t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqKpkdRRLZw&t=4s)
