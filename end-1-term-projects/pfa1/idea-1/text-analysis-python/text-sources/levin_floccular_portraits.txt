Floccular Portraits (1999). In the Floccular Portrait system, filaments drawn by the user of Floccus are buffeted by forces derived from a hidden but underlying photograph. Light-colored filaments are attracted to bright regions of the photograph, while dark filaments are attracted to dark regions. I used these simple rules to coalesce piles of casual scribbles into several portraits of my colleagues. The results are wispy, organic and sometimes unsettling transformations: chiaroscuros in hair.
