The Learning Machines are interactive sculptures that use mid-20th century mechanical voting machines (made by the Automatic Voting Machine Corporation) as an interface. Participants use them to vote on a series of choices posed as dichotomies that range from the poignant to the absurd. Upon voting, the participant receives a unique video response. These brief, user-specific audiovisuals draw on datasets of media developed for and employed in machine learning research. Real-time results from voting will be displayed in the gallery. The machines pair typically innocuous words as oppositional choices, a gesture underscoring the lack of choice we feel when presented with reductive binaries.
